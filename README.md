# Change-in-sanitary-registers-Database
 In this project, with the data extracted in my other project where I explore the webpage and extract updated data of the products in it (thousands of products in our user) we compare the status registered in our local database (saved in Excel for workers) and highlight ONLY the products that are returned in the platform but NOT in our database. All this to the fact we are not noticed to this change, and looking manually is not efficient (nor humanly possible).


There are two versions of this code, one in python an other in MATLAB, due to the ease that the last one's IDE gives us, i opted to keep updated that code.
